If you would like to start using your Cato without logging onto the MyCato webapp,
your device will need the correct operation mode specific json.

After programming your device with the conntents of drag_and_drop, select the json file
corosponding the operation mode you would like for your Cato.  Rename the desired json
to "config.json" and use it to replace the config.json in AULI_CATO.
Once the change has been made, the device will reboot in your chosen operation mode
and your Cato is good to go!

For more in depth and user friendly customization options, it is recomended to use the
MyCato webapp at mycato.auli.tech
